I did not make any of these lists, nor am I the author of any of the software linked.
While they are a very useful reference resource, they may not be 100% accurate, always doublecheck your data if you're researching something.

## Software tools
**Diagnostics**

- [HWiNFO64](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/) *(`Free Download -> Local (U.S.)` for direct download)*

	All the sensors you might ever need, temperature, voltages, fan speeds, ect.

- [MSI Afterburner (and RTSS)](https://www.msi.com/page/afterburner) *(Direct download at the bottom of the page)*

	Useful took for GPU overclocking (on any brand of GPU, it does not need to be an MSI card), setting custom fan curves, and with RTSS also an option OSD, that you can customize to show system information, FPS, and many more info.

- [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) *(Under `CLASSIC VERSIONS`, `SETUP ENGLISH`. The custom version are purely cosmetic)*

	Displays useful CPU and memory information. An easy way to check if memory is running in dual channel, and at the speed it's supposed to, for instance.

- [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/) *(ASUS ROG Themed version is purely cosmetic)*

	Handy tool to see GPU information

- [Taiphoon Burner](http://www.softnology.biz/files.html) *(`Freeware version -> CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD` for direct download)*

	Somewhat niche tool, usefull for checking what memory IC your RAM uses (press `Read` in the toolbar at the top).

**Benchmarks**

- [Unigine Superposition](https://benchmark.unigine.com/superposition)

	Modern benchmark that's capable of pushing highend GPUs, especially on 1080p Extreme and 8k optimized.

- [Unigine Heaven](https://benchmark.unigine.com/heaven)

	Older (and much smaller, download wise) benchmark still provides a good baseline for both stability testing, and thermal performance.

- [Cinebench R15](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/cinebench-15-download.html) *(Bottom of the page, `Download from Author` for direct download)*

	CPU benchmark in the form of a tile based renderer. Scales well, scores are consistent, not a good stability test however.

- [Cinebench R20](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/support/downloads/) *(`Cinebench R20 -> CINEBENCH R20 WINDOWS` for direct download, also available on windows store)*

	Similar to R15, but is quite a bit more taxing and reasonably usable for stability testing if looped. Scores are supposedly much more inconsistent, however.

- [Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/)

	CPU torture / stability test, can run incredibly hot (especially on Small/Smallest FFT), so make sure you have proper cooling before using this.

- [Furmark](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/)

	GPU torture test. Do note many GPUs will throttle clocks when they detect furmark, so not ideal for stability testing. (MSI's [Kombustor](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/) is a very similar tool).
